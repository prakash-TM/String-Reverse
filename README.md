## String Reverse in JS

## Question :

### Given a string that contains words seperated by digits(0-9). Reverse words in place
### Eg: asd1fa -> dsa1af


## Algorithm :
 - step1: get the string as the variable name is str
 - step2: declare empty array named arr
 - step3: convert str in to the array as named arr and add number string(like '1') in that str
 - step4: declare two empty strings named as it_str and rev
 - step5: assign a for loop and iterate the arr
 - step6: check is the iterable element is present in alphabets a to z
 - step7: if yes push in to the it_str string
 - step8: if no 
 - step9: concat all strings and print
